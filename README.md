# Detection of canine and feline intestinal parasites using computer-vision
This repository contains the implementation and report for my **BSc thesis**, which investigates the use of **YOLOv11** for object detection of parasites in microscopic images. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of modern computer vision architectures in aiding veterinary diagnostics by automating parasite detection.

## Overview
- **Problem**: Manual microscopy for parasite identification is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge.  
- **Solution**: This project applies **YOLOv11** with novel modules to detect and classify parasites in fecal microscopy images.  
- **Dataset**: A novel dataset of 313 annotated microscopic images of canine and feline parasites, curated with the assistance of a domain expert.  
- **Contribution**:  
  - Fine-tuned YOLOv11 with extensive hyperparameter optimization.  
  - Applied bounding boxâ€“based object detection for parasite localization.  
  - Demonstrated strong detection performance, showing potential for integration into digital veterinary diagnostics.  

The model parameters, as well as sample code for training and evaluating the model is provided.

The detailed methodology, experiments, and results are documented in the full thesis report [here](Thesis.pdf).

Due to privacy constraints, the dataset is not directly included. Please contact me for access, or replace with your own dataset.
